# {PandemicSim}: Simulate pandemics

With this package you can simulate a pandemic for a population of dots
living in a small box. You have a lot of options to change the pandemic.
For example you can change the number of individuals or increase the
populationâ€™s mobility. You can also make the disease more infectious or
more deadly and you can change how fast individuals recover. You can
even simulate the effect of countermeasures.
