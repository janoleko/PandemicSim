# {PandemicSim}: Simulate pandemics

With this package you can simulate a pandemic for a population of dots
living in a small box. You have a lot of options to change the pandemic.
For example you can change the number of individuals or increase the
populationâ€™s mobility. You can also make the disease more infectious or
more deadly and you can change how fast individuals recover. You can
even simulate the effect of countermeasures.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("janoleko/PandemicSim")
```

## Example

First simulate the pandemic (in this case with default settings, but you
could change them)

``` r
pandemic = sim_pandemic()
```

Then plot the result

``` r
plot_pandemic(pandemic, t = 100)
```

``` r
plot_pandemic(pandemic, t = 200)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-2.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
plot_pandemic(pandemic, t = 300)
```
